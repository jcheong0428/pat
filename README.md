# Pose Analysis Toolbox (PAT)

# Intro
This toolbox hosts useful functions to extract features and analyze pose data extracted from OpenPose.  

Ultimately we want this to be a package & class.  
But first let's write functions in separate notebooks in the `notebooks` folders that would be included in the package.

# Instructions
Clone the repository, download the Sherlock OpenPose data and extract to `notebooks/output/json`.

# Features
# [checkbox:checked] Load data
# [checkbox:checked] Plot and inspect data
# [checkbox:checked] Extract just the pose_2d keypoints
# [checkbox:checked] Filter based on personid
# [checkbox:checked] Extract Distance Matrix across keypoints
# [checkbox:unchecked] Normalize keypoints to common space. Scale, rotate?.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Extract Entropy.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Extract Synchrony.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Extract Center of Mass per frame.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Example of comparing distance between 2 or multiple people.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Extract Velocity across frame.
# [checkbox:unchecked] Extract Acceleration across frame.
